# Starter-Friendly Electrical Design for DIY Assembly

This project is an electrical design crafted to be accessible for **beginners**. It employs **through-hole components (THD)**, making it easy to assemble with a standard soldering iron. All complex circuitry is integrated into modules that mount directly onto the main PCB, eliminating the need for surface-mount devices (SMD) and simplifying the soldering process.

## Features

- **Overvoltage Protection**: Prevents damage from voltage spikes.
- **Reverse Voltage Protection**: Guards against incorrect polarity connections.
- **Active Buzzer & LED Indicators**: Provides clear audio and visual feedback.
- **Energy-Efficient Components**: Designed to conserve power.
- **Flexible Input Voltage (5-16V)**: Compatible with a range of sources, including solar panels.
- **Microcontroller Reset Button**: Convenient reset for the ESP32 microcontroller.
- **Input Power Options**: Supports both DC barrel jack and PH2 connectors.

## PCB Specifications

- **4-Layer PCB**
- **Dimensions**: 100x100 mm
- **Manufacturing**: Gerber files are available in the `gerber` directory, ready for JLCPCB.
